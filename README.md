# JeuDeMarienbad

The Marienbad game is a Zero-Sum game introduced in the famous movie "L'année dernière à Marienbad" by Alain Resnais and Alain Robbe-Grillet in 1961. For further details, see the wikipedia page (in French, https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeu_de_Marienbad) dedicated to this game.

In the context of AI getting better and better in complex games, such as Go, we decided to implement an innovative method to this simple game in order to build the best player. The method used is Monte-Carlo tree search (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search). It is a cutting-edge and new method, and applying it to this famous game is an interresting problem for us.

The implementation is in Python, using notebooks.
